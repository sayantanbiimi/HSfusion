# HSfusion
This repository hosts the codes to implement Horseshoe shrinkage based methods for Bayesian fusion estimation. The original paper can be found in arXiv at [add url].

There are two main source files. The file 'gen-linear-chain.R' generates piecewise constant signals. Users can change the dimension of the signal along with their patterns and values.
